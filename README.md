# StudentsCourses
(1) Create Student class containing an ID, a last name, and a list of course names such as "COP2210" or "COP2250"

(2) Create a class named StudentTest that contains a List of students

In the class constructor, create 10 students and add them to the list. Each
student's ID must be different. Each student you add to the list must contain at least 3 different
course names. Make sure the students do not all have the same courses, although there should
be some overlap (see the sample below). The student names must be inserted into the list in
random order (not sorted).

(3) Sort the list in ascending order by student last name and display the list. For each student,
display the ID, last name, and list of courses on a single line.
